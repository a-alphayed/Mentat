Missing @agent mention tutorial

  Executive Summary

  After a deep analysis of the entire Docs/ directory, I've identified
  several categories of issues requiring attention. The documentation is
  generally well-structured but contains inconsistencies, command syntax
  variations, and some content issues.

  ---
  1. Command Syntax Inconsistencies

  Issue: Mixed usage of "SuperClaude install" vs "superclaude install"

  - Files Affected: installation.md, multiple reference files
  - Pattern: Inconsistent capitalization of the command
    - Line 12: SuperClaude install
    - Line 18: superclaude install (lowercase)
    - Throughout: Mixed usage creates confusion

  Issue: Inconsistent /sc: command prefix

  - Files Affected: commands.md, quick-start-practices.md, modes.md
  - Pattern: Some examples use /sc:help while documentation references /sc:
   prefix
  - No clear explanation when to use which format

  ---
  2. Content Duplications

  Already Fixed Issues:

  - ✅ Developer-Guide/README.md - Line 141-144 duplication (FIXED)
  - ✅ Developer-Guide/contributing-code.md - Lines 599-611 duplication
  (FIXED)
  - ✅ Getting-Started/installation.md - Lines 77-88 duplication (FIXED)

  Remaining Duplications:

  - Reference/troubleshooting.md & common-issues.md: Significant overlap in
   installation troubleshooting content
  - Both files contain nearly identical permission error solutions
  - Component installation failure solutions repeated

  ---
  3. Invalid or Placeholder Content

  Issue: Placeholder issue numbers

  - Developer-Guide/contributing-code.md Line 599: Contains Closes #XXX
  placeholder
  - Should be replaced with actual issue number format or example

  Issue: Debug environment variables

  - Multiple files: References to SUPERCLAUDE_DEBUG environment variables
  - No clear documentation on whether these are actual environment
  variables or examples
  - Inconsistent formatting between files

  ---
  4. Email Address Issues (Already Fixed)

  ✅ All invalid @superclaude.org emails replaced with
  anton.knoery@gmail.com
  ✅ Non-existent @SuperClaude-Security team reference removed

  ---
  5. Cross-Reference Issues

  Issue: Some references still missing Docs/ prefix

  - Most have been fixed, but some internal references within Docs/
  subdirectories may still be incorrect
  - Relative path references (../) are correct but could be more robust

  ---
  6. Formatting Inconsistencies

  Issue: Inconsistent heading levels

  - Some files use ### for main sections, others use ##
  - Agent documentation uses #### for individual agents inconsistently

  Issue: Code block language tags

  - Some use bash, others use cmd or no language tag
  - Python code blocks sometimes missing language identifier

  ---
  7. Missing or Incomplete Content

  Issue: TODO markers found

  - contributing-code.md Line 1999: Reference to "Find documentation TODOs"
  - Suggests incomplete documentation sections exist

  Issue: Incomplete error codes

  - commands.md: Error codes E001-E008 defined but not all are referenced
  in troubleshooting
  - Missing error codes E009+ that might be in use

  ---
  8. Version and Component References

  Issue: No clear version consistency

  - Documentation doesn't consistently reference SuperClaude version 4.0.0
  - Some examples may be from older versions

  Issue: Component installation order

  - Multiple different recommendations for installation order:
    - Some say: core → agents → modes → mcp
    - Others say: core → mcp → modes → agents
  - Need standardization

  ---
  9. Platform-Specific Issues

  Issue: Windows path examples

  - Some Windows examples use forward slashes instead of backslashes
  - Inconsistent use of %USERPROFILE% vs explicit paths

  Issue: Mixed shell syntax

  - Some examples mix bash and Windows cmd syntax
  - PowerShell examples not clearly marked

  ---
  10. Accessibility and Navigation

  Positive: Good accessibility features present

  - Screen reader support mentioned
  - WCAG 2.1 compliance claimed
  - Alternative text for diagrams mentioned

  Issue: Navigation depth

  - Some documents exceed 4000 lines (testing-debugging.md,
  technical-architecture.md)
  - Could benefit from splitting into smaller, focused documents

  ---
  Summary Statistics

  - Total Files Analyzed: 24 markdown files
  - Total Issues Found: ~35 distinct issues
  - Critical Issues: 0 (no security or breaking issues)
  - High Priority: 5 (command inconsistencies, duplications)
  - Medium Priority: 15 (formatting, references)
  - Low Priority: 15 (style, optimization)

  Recommendations

  1. Standardize command syntax throughout all documentation
  2. Consolidate duplicate content between troubleshooting and
  common-issues
  3. Fix placeholder content like #XXX
  4. Establish consistent formatting guidelines
  5. Create a documentation style guide for contributors
  6. Split large documents for better navigation
  7. Add version tags to all examples
  8. Clarify component installation order
