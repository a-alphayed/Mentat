Missing @agent mention tutorial

  Executive Summary

  After a deep analysis of the entire Docs/ directory, I've identified
  several categories of issues requiring attention. The documentation is
  generally well-structured but contains inconsistencies, command syntax
  variations, and some content issues.

  3. Invalid or Placeholder Content

  Issue: Placeholder issue numbers

  - Developer-Guide/contributing-code.md Line 599: Contains Closes #XXX
  placeholder
  - Should be replaced with actual issue number format or example

  Issue: Debug environment variables

  - Multiple files: References to SUPERCLAUDE_DEBUG environment variables
  - No clear documentation on whether these are actual environment
  variables or examples
  - Inconsistent formatting between files

  ---

  7. Missing or Incomplete Content

  Issue: TODO markers found

  - contributing-code.md Line 1999: Reference to "Find documentation TODOs"
  - Suggests incomplete documentation sections exist

  ---
  8. Version and Component References

  Issue: No clear version consistency

  - Documentation doesn't consistently reference SuperClaude version 4.0.0
  - Some examples may be from older versions

  Issue: Component installation order

  - Multiple different recommendations for installation order:
    - Some say: core → agents → modes → mcp
    - Others say: core → mcp → modes → agents
  - Need standardization

  10. Accessibility and Navigation

  Positive: Good accessibility features present

  - Screen reader support mentioned
  - WCAG 2.1 compliance claimed
  - Alternative text for diagrams mentioned

  Issue: Navigation depth

  - Some documents exceed 4000 lines (testing-debugging.md,
  technical-architecture.md)
  - Could benefit from splitting into smaller, focused documents

  Summary Statistics

  - Total Files Analyzed: 24 markdown files
  - Total Issues Found: ~35 distinct issues
  - Critical Issues: 0 (no security or breaking issues)
  - High Priority: 5 (command inconsistencies, duplications)
  - Medium Priority: 15 (formatting, references)
  - Low Priority: 15 (style, optimization)

  Recommendations

  1. Standardize command syntax throughout all documentation
  2. Consolidate duplicate content between troubleshooting and
  common-issues
  3. Fix placeholder content like #XXX
  4. Establish consistent formatting guidelines
  5. Create a documentation style guide for contributors
  6. Split large documents for better navigation
  7. Add version tags to all examples
  8. Clarify component installation order
