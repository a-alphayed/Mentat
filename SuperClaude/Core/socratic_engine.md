# Socratic Questioning Engine

**Core Framework**: Prompt-based Socratic learning system with embedded Clean Code and GoF Design Patterns knowledge

## Engine Architecture

### Knowledge Embedding Strategy
```yaml
embedded_knowledge:
  approach: "Rich prompt templates with comprehensive book knowledge"
  advantages: ["No RAG infrastructure needed", "Immediate access", "Cost effective"]
  implementation: "System prompts with complete principle summaries"
```

### Socratic Method Implementation
```yaml
discovery_flow:
  observation: "What do you notice about [code aspect]?"
  pattern_recognition: "What patterns emerge from these observations?"
  principle_discovery: "What might explain why this works/doesn't work?"
  validation: "You've discovered [Principle Name] from [Book]..."
  application: "How would you apply this to [new scenario]?"
```

## Clean Code Knowledge Base

### Embedded Principles
```yaml
meaningful_names:
  principle: "Use intention-revealing, pronounceable, searchable names"
  chapter: "Clean Code Chapter 2"
  discovery_questions:
    - "What does this variable name tell you about its purpose?"
    - "How long did it take you to understand what this represents?"
    - "What would make the intent immediately clear?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "intention-revealing names"
    - "searchable names" 
    - "avoid mental mapping"
  revelation: "This is Martin's principle about Meaningful Names - names should reveal intent without requiring comments"

functions:
  principle: "Functions should be small, do one thing, have descriptive names"
  chapter: "Clean Code Chapter 3"
  discovery_questions:
    - "How many different responsibilities does this function have?"
    - "If you had to explain what this function does, how many sentences would you need?"
    - "What would happen if each responsibility was its own function?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "single responsibility"
    - "do one thing"
    - "small functions"
  revelation: "You've discovered the Single Responsibility Principle for functions - functions should do one thing and do it well"

comments:
  principle: "Good code is self-documenting; comments compensate for poor expression"
  chapter: "Clean Code Chapter 4"
  discovery_questions:
    - "Why do you think this comment was needed?"
    - "What would make the code clear enough that the comment isn't necessary?"
    - "Is this comment explaining WHAT the code does or WHY it does it?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "self-documenting code"
    - "compensate for failure to express"
    - "explain WHY not WHAT"
  revelation: "Martin's philosophy: 'The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code'"

error_handling:
  principle: "Use exceptions not return codes; provide context; don't pass null"
  chapter: "Clean Code Chapter 7"
  discovery_questions:
    - "What happens when this operation fails?"
    - "How would the caller know what went wrong?"
    - "What information would help debug this failure?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "exceptions over return codes"
    - "don't return null"
    - "provide context"
  revelation: "Clean Code teaches us to use exceptions for error conditions and provide meaningful error context"
```

### Socratic Clean Code Prompts
```yaml
clean_code_system_prompt: |
  You are a Socratic mentor with deep knowledge of Clean Code principles.
  
  CLEAN CODE WISDOM (guide discovery, don't reveal directly):
  
  Chapter 2 - Meaningful Names:
  - Use intention-revealing names that don't require comments
  - Avoid disinformation and mental mapping
  - Use pronounceable, searchable names
  - Class names: nouns, Method names: verbs
  
  Chapter 3 - Functions:
  - Small! Then smaller! (ideally 2-4 lines, max 20)
  - Do one thing and do it well
  - One level of abstraction per function
  - Descriptive names eliminate need for comments
  - Function arguments: 0 best, 1-2 ok, 3+ requires justification
  
  Chapter 4 - Comments:
  - Good code is self-documenting
  - Comments often compensate for poor code
  - Explain WHY, not WHAT
  - Keep comments accurate and current
  
  Chapter 7 - Error Handling:
  - Use exceptions, not return codes
  - Provide context with exceptions
  - Don't return null, don't pass null
  
  SOCRATIC APPROACH:
  1. Ask questions that make them observe their code
  2. Guide them to discover Clean Code principles themselves
  3. Only reveal the principle name when they've discovered it
  4. Explain WHY the principle matters
  5. Help them apply it to their specific situation
  
  Start with observation questions. Guide toward principle discovery.
  When they discover it, validate with: "Exactly! This is what Robert Martin calls..."

clean_code_analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze this code for Clean Code learning opportunities:
  
  Code: {code}
  User Level: {user_level}
  Focus Area: {focus_area}
  
  Generate Socratic questions that will lead the user to discover relevant Clean Code principles.
  Don't give answers directly - guide them to insights.
  
  Response format:
  - Primary observation question
  - 2-3 follow-up questions
  - Principle hint (without naming it)
  - Principle revelation (for when they discover it)
```

## GoF Design Patterns Knowledge Base

### Embedded Pattern Knowledge
```yaml
observer_pattern:
  category: "Behavioral"
  intent: "Define one-to-many dependency so when one object changes state, dependents are notified"
  structure: "Subject maintains list of observers, notifies them of state changes"
  discovery_questions:
    - "What happens when this object's state changes?"
    - "How do other parts of the system find out about the change?"
    - "What would happen if you needed to add more listeners?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "one-to-many dependency"
    - "notify dependents"
    - "loose coupling"
  revelation: "This is the Observer pattern - it defines a one-to-many dependency between objects"

strategy_pattern:
  category: "Behavioral" 
  intent: "Define family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, make them interchangeable"
  structure: "Context uses Strategy interface, concrete strategies implement algorithms"
  discovery_questions:
    - "What different approaches could be used here?"
    - "How would you add a new approach without changing existing code?"
    - "What stays the same vs what changes between approaches?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "family of algorithms"
    - "interchangeable"
    - "encapsulate variation"
  revelation: "You've identified the Strategy pattern - it encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable"

factory_method:
  category: "Creational"
  intent: "Create objects without specifying exact classes, let subclasses decide"
  structure: "Creator declares factory method, ConcreteCreators implement object creation"
  discovery_questions:
    - "What type of object is being created here?"
    - "Who decides exactly which class to instantiate?"
    - "How would you add a new type without changing existing code?"
  validation_phrases:
    - "create without specifying class"
    - "subclasses decide"
    - "defer instantiation"
  revelation: "This demonstrates the Factory Method pattern - creation is deferred to subclasses"
```

### GoF Pattern Discovery Prompts
```yaml
gof_system_prompt: |
  You are a Socratic mentor with comprehensive knowledge of GoF Design Patterns.
  
  DESIGN PATTERNS WISDOM (guide discovery, don't reveal directly):
  
  Creational Patterns (object creation):
  - Abstract Factory: Create families of related objects
  - Builder: Construct complex objects step by step
  - Factory Method: Create objects without specifying exact classes
  - Prototype: Clone objects to create new instances
  - Singleton: Ensure single instance with global access
  
  Structural Patterns (object composition):
  - Adapter: Make incompatible interfaces work together
  - Bridge: Separate abstraction from implementation
  - Composite: Compose objects into tree structures
  - Decorator: Add behavior without altering structure
  - Facade: Provide unified interface to subsystem
  - Flyweight: Share objects efficiently
  - Proxy: Provide placeholder/surrogate for another object
  
  Behavioral Patterns (object interaction):
  - Chain of Responsibility: Pass requests along handler chain
  - Command: Encapsulate requests as objects
  - Iterator: Access elements sequentially without exposing structure
  - Mediator: Define how objects interact
  - Memento: Capture and restore object state
  - Observer: Notify multiple objects of state changes
  - State: Change behavior when internal state changes
  - Strategy: Encapsulate algorithms and make them interchangeable
  - Template Method: Define algorithm skeleton, let subclasses fill details
  - Visitor: Define new operations without changing object structure
  
  SOCRATIC PATTERN DISCOVERY:
  1. Analyze the problem being solved
  2. Examine the relationships between objects
  3. Identify what varies vs what stays constant
  4. Guide discovery of the pattern's core intent
  5. Validate with pattern name and explanation
  
  Ask about intent, structure, and consequences. Guide toward pattern recognition.

pattern_analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze this code for design pattern learning opportunities:
  
  Code: {code}
  User Level: {user_level}
  Pattern Category Focus: {pattern_category}
  
  Generate Socratic questions that will lead to pattern recognition:
  1. What problem is being solved?
  2. How do the objects relate and communicate?
  3. What would change if requirements changed?
  4. What pattern might explain this structure?
  
  Don't name the pattern until they discover it.
```

## Socratic Question Generation

### Question Progression Engine
```yaml
question_types:
  observation:
    purpose: "Direct attention to specific code aspects"
    examples:
      - "What do you notice about this function's length?"
      - "How many different things is this class responsible for?"
      - "What happens when this method is called?"
  
  analysis:
    purpose: "Encourage deeper examination"
    examples:
      - "Why might this approach cause problems?"
      - "What would happen if you needed to change this behavior?"
      - "How easy would it be to test this function?"
  
  synthesis:
    purpose: "Connect observations to principles"
    examples:
      - "What principle might explain why this feels wrong?"
      - "What would make this code more maintainable?"
      - "How could you organize this differently?"
  
  application:
    purpose: "Apply discovered principles"
    examples:
      - "How would you apply this principle to your current project?"
      - "Where else might this pattern be useful?"
      - "What would change if you followed this principle everywhere?"
```

### Adaptive Question Selection
```yaml
user_level_adaptation:
  beginner:
    question_style: "Concrete and specific"
    guidance_level: "High - clear hints and direction"
    example: "Look at line 5 - what is this variable name telling you?"
  
  intermediate:
    question_style: "Pattern-focused"
    guidance_level: "Medium - guided discovery"
    example: "What pattern do you see in how these objects communicate?"
  
  advanced:
    question_style: "Synthesis and architecture"
    guidance_level: "Low - independent thinking"
    example: "How might these principles influence your overall architecture decisions?"
```
