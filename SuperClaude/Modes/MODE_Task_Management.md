# Task Management Mode

## Core Principles
- **Evidence-Based Progress**: Measurable outcomes with quantified task completion metrics
- **Single Focus Protocol**: One active task at a time with strict state management
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate status changes with comprehensive tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Validation before completion with multi-step verification cycles

## Architecture Layers

### Layer 1: TodoRead/TodoWrite (Session Tasks)
- **Scope**: Current Claude Code session with real-time state management
- **States**: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked with strict transitions
- **Capacity**: 3-20 tasks per session with dynamic load balancing
- **Integration**: Foundation layer connecting to project and orchestration systems

### Layer 2: /task Command (Project Management)
- **Scope**: Multi-session features spanning days to weeks with persistence
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization (Epic â†’ Story â†’ Task) with dependency mapping
- **Persistence**: Cross-session state management with comprehensive tracking
- **Coordination**: Inter-layer communication with session lifecycle integration

### Layer 3: /spawn Command (Meta-Orchestration)
- **Scope**: Complex multi-domain operations with system-wide coordination
- **Features**: Parallel/sequential coordination with intelligent tool management
- **Management**: Resource allocation and dependency resolution across domains
- **Intelligence**: Advanced decision-making with compound intelligence coordination

### Layer 4: /loop Command (Iterative Enhancement)
- **Scope**: Progressive refinement workflows with validation cycles
- **Features**: Iteration cycles with comprehensive validation and quality gates
- **Optimization**: Performance improvements through iterative analysis
- **Analytics**: Measurement and feedback loops with continuous learning

## Task Detection and Creation

### Automatic Triggers
- **Multi-step Operations**: 3+ step sequences with dependency analysis
- **Keywords**: build, implement, create, fix, optimize, refactor with context awareness
- **Scope Indicators**: system, feature, comprehensive, complete with complexity assessment
- **Complexity Thresholds**: Operations exceeding 0.4 complexity score with multi-domain impact
- **File Count Triggers**: 3+ files for delegation, 2+ directories for coordination
- **Performance Opportunities**: Auto-detect parallelizable operations with time estimates

### Task State Management
- **pending** ðŸ“‹: Ready for execution with dependency validation
- **in_progress** ðŸ”„: Currently active (ONE per session) with progress tracking
- **blocked** ðŸš§: Waiting on dependency with automated resolution monitoring
- **completed** âœ…: Successfully finished with quality validation and evidence

## Related Flags

### Sub-Agent Delegation Flags
**`--delegate [files|folders|auto]`**

- Prevents resource exhaustion in complex scenarios with proactive monitoring

### Wave Orchestration Flags
**`--wave-mode [auto|force|off]`**
- Control wave orchestration activation with intelligent threshold detection
- **auto**: Auto-activates based on complexity >0.4 AND file_count >3 AND operation_types >2
- **force**: Override auto-detection and force wave mode for borderline cases

- Select wave orchestration strategy with context-aware optimization
- **progressive**: Iterative enhancement for incremental improvements with validation cycles
- **systematic**: Comprehensive methodical analysis for complex problems with full coverage
- **adaptive**: Dynamic configuration based on varying complexity with real-time adjustment
- **enterprise**: Large-scale orchestration for >100 files with >0.7 complexity threshold

**`--wave-delegation [files|folders|tasks]`**
- Control how Wave system delegates work to Sub-Agent with strategic coordination
- **files**: Sub-Agent delegates individual file analysis across waves with precision targeting
- **folders**: Sub-Agent delegates directory-level analysis across waves with structural organization
- **tasks**: Sub-Agent delegates by task type (security, performance, quality, architecture) with domain specialization

### Iterative Enhancement Flags
**`--loop`**
- Enable iterative improvement mode for commands with automatic validation
- Auto-activates: Quality improvement requests, refinement operations, polish tasks with pattern detection
- Compatible operations: /improve, /refine, /enhance, /fix, /cleanup, /analyze with full integration
- Default: 3 iterations with automatic validation and quality gate enforcement

**`--iterations [n]`**
- Control number of improvement cycles (default: 3, range: 1-10)
- Overrides intelligent default based on operation complexity with adaptive optimization

**`--interactive`**
- Enable user confirmation between iterations with comprehensive review cycles
- Pauses for review and approval before each cycle with detailed progress reporting
- Allows manual guidance and course correction with decision point integration

## Auto-Activation Thresholds
- **Sub-Agent Delegation**: >2 directories OR >3 files OR complexity >0.4 with multi-condition evaluation
- **Wave Mode**: complexity â‰¥0.4 AND files >3 AND operation_types >2 with sophisticated logic
- **Loop Mode**: polish, refine, enhance, improve keywords detected with contextual analysis
