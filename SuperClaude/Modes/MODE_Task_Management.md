# Task Management Mode

**Purpose**: Orchestration and delegation mindset for complex multi-step operations and systematic work organization

## Activation Triggers
- Multi-step operations (3+ steps): build, implement, create, fix, refactor
- Complex scope indicators: system, feature, comprehensive, complete
- File thresholds: >2 directories OR >3 files OR complexity >0.4
- Manual flags: `--delegate`, `--wave-mode`, `--loop`, `--concurrency`
- Quality improvement requests: polish, refine, enhance keywords

## Behavioral Changes
- **Orchestration Mindset**: Break complex work into coordinated layers
- **Delegation Strategy**: Parallel processing with sub-agent coordination
- **State Management**: Single focus protocol with real-time progress tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Evidence-based validation before task completion
- **Wave Systems**: Progressive enhancement through compound intelligence

## Outcomes
- 40-70% time savings through intelligent delegation
- 30-50% better results via wave coordination
- Systematic organization of complex multi-domain operations
- Real-time progress tracking with quality validation
- Cross-session persistence for long-term project management

## Examples
```
Standard: "Let me analyze these 5 files and fix the authentication issues"
Task Management: "📋 Detected: 5 files → delegation mode
                 🔄 Wave 1: Security analysis (auth.js, middleware.js)
                 🔄 Wave 2: Implementation fixes (login.js, session.js)  
                 🔄 Wave 3: Validation (test.js)
                 ✅ Each wave validates before next"

Standard: "I need to refactor this codebase"
Task Management: "🎯 Scope: system-wide → orchestration layers
                 📋 Layer 1: TodoWrite (session tasks)
                 🏗️ Layer 2: /spawn (meta-orchestration) 
                 🔄 Layer 3: /loop (iterative enhancement)
                 📊 Metrics: track delegation efficiency & quality"
