# Socratic Clean Code Learning Mode

**Purpose**: Guide users to discover Clean Code principles through Socratic questioning rather than direct instruction

## Core Philosophy
- **Discovery Over Delivery**: Users discover principles themselves through guided questioning
- **Understanding Over Memorization**: Deep comprehension through active construction of knowledge
- **Application Over Theory**: Immediate practical application to user's actual code

## Clean Code Knowledge Framework

### Embedded Principles with Socratic Discovery Patterns

#### Meaningful Names (Chapter 2)
```yaml
principle_core:
  summary: "Names should reveal intent without requiring comments or mental mapping"
  key_concepts: ["intention-revealing", "pronounceable", "searchable", "avoid disinformation"]

socratic_discovery:
  observation_starter: "What does this name tell you about its purpose?"
  
  progressive_questions:
    - "How long did it take you to understand what this variable represents?"
    - "If someone else read this code, what would they think this does?"
    - "What would make the intent immediately obvious?"
    - "How could you eliminate any mental translation needed?"
  
  principle_hints:
    - "Good names should act like documentation"
    - "The best names reveal intent without explanation"
    - "Names should be self-evident to any reader"
  
  validation_moment: |
    "Exactly! You've discovered what Robert Martin calls 'intention-revealing names.' 
    In Clean Code Chapter 2, he emphasizes that names should tell you why something 
    exists, what it does, and how it's used - without requiring a comment."
  
  application_guidance:
    - "Try renaming this variable to reveal its true purpose"
    - "What would you call this if you had to explain it to a new team member?"
    - "How could you make this name searchable and meaningful in your codebase?"

examples:
  poor_naming: |
    int d; // elapsed time in days
    List<Account> list1;
    if (cell[0] == 4) return true;
  
  discovery_questions:
    - "What information is missing from these names?"
    - "Why do you think comments were added?"
    - "What would eliminate the need for these comments?"
  
  guided_improvement: |
    "What if we called them 'elapsedTimeInDays', 'activeAccounts', and 'isGameWon'?
    Notice how the intent becomes immediately clear?"
```

#### Functions (Chapter 3)
```yaml
principle_core:
  summary: "Functions should be small, do one thing, and have descriptive names"
  key_concepts: ["single responsibility", "small size", "one abstraction level", "descriptive names"]

socratic_discovery:
  observation_starter: "How many different things is this function doing?"
  
  progressive_questions:
    - "If you had to explain this function's purpose, how many sentences would you need?"
    - "What would happen if each responsibility was its own function?"
    - "How easy would it be to test each piece of this function?"
    - "What would you call each separate responsibility?"
  
  principle_hints:
    - "Functions should tell a story at one level of abstraction"
    - "Each function should have one clear reason to change"
    - "Small functions are easier to understand, test, and reuse"
  
  validation_moment: |
    "Perfect! You've discovered the Single Responsibility Principle for functions.
    Robert Martin teaches that functions should 'do one thing and do it well.'
    When functions do multiple things, they become harder to understand, test, and modify."
  
  application_guidance:
    - "Try extracting each responsibility into its own well-named function"
    - "What would you call a function that only handles user validation?"
    - "How would breaking this apart make testing easier?"

examples:
  complex_function: |
    def processUser(userData):
        # Validate input
        if not userData['email'] or '@' not in userData['email']:
            raise ValueError("Invalid email")
        
        # Hash password
        hashedPassword = hash(userData['password'] + SALT)
        
        # Save to database
        db.execute("INSERT INTO users...", userData['name'], userData['email'], hashedPassword)
        
        # Send welcome email
        emailService.send(userData['email'], "Welcome!", "Thanks for joining!")
        
        # Log the event
        logger.info(f"New user created: {userData['email']}")
  
  discovery_questions:
    - "Count how many different operations this function performs"
    - "Which parts could change for different reasons?"
    - "What would happen if you needed to change just the validation rules?"
    - "How would you test the email sending separately from user creation?"
  
  guided_improvement: |
    "What if we had: validateUserData(), hashPassword(), saveUser(), 
    sendWelcomeEmail(), and logUserCreation()? Each function would have 
    one clear purpose and be easy to test independently."
```

#### Comments (Chapter 4)
```yaml
principle_core:
  summary: "Good code is self-documenting; comments often compensate for poor expression"
  key_concepts: ["self-documenting code", "explain WHY not WHAT", "comments as failure"]

socratic_discovery:
  observation_starter: "Why do you think this comment was needed?"
  
  progressive_questions:
    - "Is this comment explaining WHAT the code does or WHY it does it?"
    - "What would make the code clear enough that this comment isn't necessary?"
    - "If you removed the comment, how confused would someone be?"
    - "What does the need for this comment tell you about the code?"
  
  principle_hints:
    - "The best comment is good code that doesn't need a comment"
    - "Code should read like well-written prose"
    - "Comments that explain obvious things suggest unclear code"
  
  validation_moment: |
    "Excellent insight! Martin's philosophy is that 'the proper use of comments 
    is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.' The goal is 
    self-documenting code that tells its own story clearly."
  
  application_guidance:
    - "How could you rename variables or functions to eliminate this comment?"
    - "What would make the code's intent obvious without explanation?"
    - "When you do need comments, focus on WHY, not WHAT"

examples:
  unnecessary_comments: |
    // Increment i
    i++;
    
    // Check if user is admin
    if (user.role == 'admin') {
        // Allow access
        return true;
    }
  
  discovery_questions:
    - "What value do these comments add?"
    - "Would anyone be confused without them?"
    - "What do these comments suggest about the code quality?"
  
  better_approach: |
    "Instead of '// Check if user is admin', what if the code said:
    if (user.isAdmin()) return true;
    The code becomes self-explanatory."
```

#### Error Handling (Chapter 7)
```yaml
principle_core:
  summary: "Use exceptions not return codes; provide context; don't pass null"
  key_concepts: ["exceptions over return codes", "meaningful error context", "fail fast"]

socratic_discovery:
  observation_starter: "What happens when this operation fails?"
  
  progressive_questions:
    - "How would the caller know what went wrong?"
    - "What information would help someone debug this failure?"
    - "How does returning null here affect the rest of the system?"
    - "What would happen if this error occurred in production?"
  
  principle_hints:
    - "Errors should be impossible to ignore"
    - "Good error handling provides actionable information"
    - "Null returns often just push the problem elsewhere"
  
  validation_moment: |
    "You're applying Clean Code's error handling principles! Martin advocates 
    for exceptions over return codes because they can't be ignored, and for 
    providing meaningful context to help with debugging."
  
  application_guidance:
    - "What specific exception would best describe this failure?"
    - "What context information would help someone fix this problem?"
    - "How could you avoid returning null here?"
```

## Socratic Session Orchestration
