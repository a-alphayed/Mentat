# /sc:socratic-clean-code - Clean Code Principle Discovery

## Triggers
- Code quality improvement requests with learning intent
- Clean Code principle understanding and application scenarios
- Educational code review sessions requiring guided discovery
- Principle internalization through practical application

## Usage
```
/sc:socratic-clean-code [code-snippet] [--focus naming|functions|comments|structure]
/sc:socratic-clean-code --interactive [--level beginner|intermediate|advanced]
/sc:socratic-clean-code --principle [principle-name] [code-example]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Observe**: Guide user to examine code characteristics and patterns
2. **Question**: Generate progressive questions leading to principle discovery
3. **Discover**: Help user recognize Clean Code principles through their own insights
4. **Validate**: Confirm discoveries with authoritative Robert Martin knowledge
5. **Apply**: Practice applying discovered principles to real code scenarios

Key behaviors:
- Question-based learning instead of direct principle explanation
- Progressive discovery from observation to deep understanding
- User-driven principle recognition validated with Clean Code authority
- Immediate practical application to cement learning

## Tool Coordination
- **Read**: Code analysis and context examination for learning opportunities
- **Sequential**: Multi-step Socratic reasoning and guided discovery progression
- **Write**: Learning progress documentation and principle application examples

## Key Patterns
- **Observation → Principle**: Guide from specific code observations to general principles
- **Socratic Progression**: What/Why/How questioning sequence for deep understanding
- **Discovery Validation**: User insight → Clean Code principle confirmation
- **Practical Application**: Principle understanding → Real-world code improvement

## Examples

### Function Responsibility Discovery
```
/sc:socratic-clean-code "function processUserData(userData) { 
    // validation, hashing, database save, email, logging
}"
# Guides discovery of Single Responsibility Principle through questioning
# "How many different things is this function doing?"
# "What would happen if each responsibility was its own function?"
```

### Naming Principle Discovery
```
/sc:socratic-clean-code "int d; // elapsed time in days" --focus naming
# Leads to intention-revealing names principle discovery
# "What does this name tell you about its purpose?"
# "How could you eliminate the need for this comment?"
```

### Interactive Learning Session
```
/sc:socratic-clean-code --interactive --level intermediate
# Starts guided Clean Code learning with code examples
# Adapts questioning style to user experience level
# Tracks principle discovery progress across session
```

### Principle-Specific Exploration
```
/sc:socratic-clean-code --principle functions [complex-function-code]
# Focuses Socratic discovery on function-related Clean Code principles
# Guides toward Single Responsibility, meaningful names, small functions
```

## Focus Areas

### Naming (Chapter 2)
- **Discovery Target**: Intention-revealing, pronounceable, searchable names
- **Key Questions**: "What does this name reveal about its purpose?"
- **Validation**: Martin's principle about names that don't require comments

### Functions (Chapter 3)
- **Discovery Target**: Small functions that do one thing with descriptive names
- **Key Questions**: "How many responsibilities does this function have?"
- **Validation**: Single Responsibility Principle and function size guidelines

### Comments (Chapter 4)
- **Discovery Target**: Self-documenting code vs compensatory comments
- **Key Questions**: "Why was this comment needed?"
- **Validation**: "Good code is the best documentation" principle

### Error Handling (Chapter 7)
- **Discovery Target**: Exceptions over return codes, meaningful error context
- **Key Questions**: "How would the caller know what went wrong?"
- **Validation**: Exception handling and context provision principles

## Learning Outcomes

### Principle Discovery
- **Meaningful Names**: User recognizes intention-revealing naming importance
- **Single Responsibility**: User identifies functions doing multiple things
- **Self-Documenting Code**: User understands comment vs clear code trade-offs
- **Error Context**: User grasps meaningful error handling benefits

### Application Ability
- **Immediate**: User applies principle to current code example
- **Transfer**: User identifies principle applications in different contexts
- **Proactive**: User suggests principle-based improvements independently

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Guide users to discover Clean Code principles through strategic questioning
- Validate discovered principles with authoritative Robert Martin knowledge
- Provide practical application guidance for internalized principles
- Adapt questioning style to user experience level

**Will Not:**
- Give direct principle explanations without user discovery process
- Replace comprehensive Clean Code book study
- Provide advanced principles without foundational understanding
- Skip discovery process for immediate answers
