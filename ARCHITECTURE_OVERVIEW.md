# SuperClaude Architecture Overview

## Introduction

SuperClaude v3 is a comprehensive framework that extends Claude Code with specialized commands, intelligent routing, and MCP server integration for advanced development workflows. The framework has evolved from a Python-based implementation to a markdown-driven orchestration system that emphasizes configuration over code.

## Core Philosophy

SuperClaude operates as an orchestration layer that:
- Enhances Claude Code with 21 specialized slash commands for common development tasks
- Integrates 6 MCP servers for extended capabilities (Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright, Morphllm, Serena)
- Provides intelligent routing and persona-based task execution
- Enables sophisticated development workflows through declarative configuration

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Framework Core (`SuperClaude/Core/`)

The framework core consists of markdown documents installed to `~/.claude/` that guide Claude's behavior:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Entry point that references all framework components
- **FLAGS.md**: Behavior modification flags (--think, --delegate, --uc, etc.)
- **PRINCIPLES.md**: Core development principles and philosophy
- **RULES.md**: Actionable rules for framework operation
- **ORCHESTRATOR.md**: Intelligent routing system for tool and persona selection
- **SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md**: Session management patterns with Serena MCP integration

### 2. Commands Layer (`SuperClaude/Commands/`)

21 slash commands organized by category:

#### Utility Commands (Basic Complexity)
- `/sc:analyze` - Code analysis and insights
- `/sc:build` - Project building and packaging
- `/sc:design` - Technical design generation
- `/sc:document` - Documentation creation
- `/sc:git` - Git operations and workflows
- `/sc:test` - Test execution and analysis
- `/sc:troubleshoot` - Problem diagnosis

#### Workflow Commands (Standard Complexity)
- `/sc:cleanup` - Code cleanup and optimization
- `/sc:estimate` - Effort estimation
- `/sc:explain` - Code explanation
- `/sc:implement` - Feature implementation
- `/sc:improve` - Code enhancement
- `/sc:index` - Project indexing

#### Orchestration Commands (Advanced Complexity)
- `/sc:brainstorm` - Interactive requirements discovery
- `/sc:task` - Multi-session task management
- `/sc:workflow` - Complex workflow orchestration

#### Special Commands (High Complexity)
- `/sc:spawn` - Meta-orchestration for complex operations
- `/sc:select-tool` - Intelligent tool selection

#### Session Commands (Cross-Session)
- `/sc:load` - Project context loading with Serena
- `/sc:save` - Session persistence and checkpointing
- `/sc:reflect` - Task reflection and validation

### 3. MCP Server Integration (`SuperClaude/MCP/`)

Six specialized MCP servers provide extended capabilities:

1. **Context7**: Official library documentation and patterns
2. **Sequential**: Multi-step problem solving and analysis
3. **Magic**: UI component generation and design systems
4. **Playwright**: Browser automation and E2E testing
5. **Morphllm**: Intelligent file editing with Fast Apply
6. **Serena**: Semantic code analysis and memory management

### 4. Behavioral Modes (`SuperClaude/Modes/`)

Four behavioral modes that modify Claude's operational approach:

1. **Brainstorming Mode**: Interactive requirements discovery
2. **Introspection Mode**: Meta-cognitive analysis
3. **Task Management Mode**: Multi-layer task orchestration
4. **Token Efficiency Mode**: Intelligent compression (30-50% reduction)

### 5. Agent System (`SuperClaude/Agents/`)

12 specialized agents organized by domain:

#### Analysis Agents
- `security-auditor`: Security vulnerability detection
- `root-cause-analyzer`: Systematic issue investigation
- `performance-optimizer`: Performance bottleneck resolution

#### Design Agents
- `system-architect`: System design and architecture
- `backend-engineer`: Backend development expertise
- `frontend-specialist`: Frontend and UI development

#### Quality Agents
- `qa-specialist`: Testing strategy and execution
- `code-refactorer`: Code quality improvement

#### Education Agents
- `technical-writer`: Documentation creation
- `code-educator`: Programming education

#### Infrastructure Agents
- `devops-engineer`: Infrastructure and deployment

#### Special Agents
- `brainstorm-PRD`: Requirements to PRD transformation

### 6. Hooks System (`SuperClaude/Hooks/`)

Python-based hooks for framework integration:

- **session_lifecycle**: Session start/checkpoint/end management
- **performance_monitor**: Real-time performance tracking
- **quality_gates**: 8-step validation cycle
- **framework_coordinator**: Framework component coordination

## Key Integration Patterns

### 1. Command-MCP Integration

Commands declare MCP server requirements in metadata:
```yaml
mcp-integration:
  servers: [serena, morphllm]
  personas: [backend-engineer]
  wave-enabled: true
```

### 2. Mode-Command Coordination

Modes provide behavioral frameworks, commands provide execution:
- Brainstorming Mode detects ambiguous requests
- `/sc:brainstorm` command executes discovery dialogue
- Mode patterns applied throughout execution

### 3. Intelligent Routing

The ORCHESTRATOR.md provides routing logic:
```yaml
pattern_matching:
  ui_component → Magic + frontend persona
  deep_analysis → Sequential + think modes
  symbol_operations → Serena + LSP precision
  pattern_edits → Morphllm + token optimization
```

### 4. Session Lifecycle Pattern

```
/sc:load → WORK → /sc:save → NEXT SESSION
    ↑                               ↓
    └────── Enhanced Context ───────┘
```

## Performance Architecture

### Target Metrics
- Memory operations: <200ms
- Project loading: <500ms
- Tool selection: <100ms
- Session save: <2000ms
- Checkpoint creation: <1000ms

### Optimization Strategies
- MCP server caching and coordination
- Token efficiency mode for large operations
- Parallel execution with wave orchestration
- Intelligent tool selection based on complexity

## Quality Assurance

### 8-Step Quality Cycle
1. Syntax Validation
2. Type Analysis
3. Lint Rules
4. Security Assessment
5. E2E Testing
6. Performance Analysis
7. Documentation Patterns
8. Integration Testing

### Quality Gates Integration
- Commands integrate at steps 2.5 and 7.5
- MCP servers provide specialized validation
- Hooks enforce quality standards
