# SuperClaude Architecture Overview

## Introduction

SuperClaude V4 Beta is a comprehensive framework that extends Claude Code with specialized commands, intelligent routing, and MCP server integration for advanced development workflows. The framework has evolved from a Python-based implementation to a markdown-driven orchestration system that emphasizes configuration over code, now featuring a production-ready hooks system and comprehensive session lifecycle management.

## Core Philosophy

SuperClaude operates as an orchestration layer that:
- Enhances Claude Code with 21 specialized slash commands for common development tasks
- Integrates 6 MCP servers for extended capabilities (Context7, Sequential, Magic, Playwright, Morphllm, Serena)
- Provides intelligent routing and persona-based task execution
- Enables sophisticated development workflows through declarative configuration

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Framework Core (`SuperClaude/Core/`)

The framework core consists of markdown documents installed to `~/.claude/` that guide Claude's behavior:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Entry point that references all framework components
- **FLAGS.md**: Behavior modification flags (--think, --delegate, --uc, etc.)
- **PRINCIPLES.md**: Core development principles and philosophy
- **RULES.md**: Actionable rules for framework operation
- **ORCHESTRATOR.md**: Intelligent routing system for tool and persona selection
- **SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md**: Session management patterns with Serena MCP integration

### 2. Commands Layer (`SuperClaude/Commands/`)

21 slash commands organized by category:

#### Utility Commands (Basic Complexity)
- `/sc:analyze` - Code analysis and insights
- `/sc:build` - Project building and packaging
- `/sc:design` - Technical design generation
- `/sc:document` - Documentation creation

### 3. MCP Server Integration (`SuperClaude/MCP/`)

Six specialized MCP servers provide extended capabilities:

1. **Context7**: Official library documentation and patterns
2. **Sequential**: Multi-step problem solving and analysis
3. **Magic**: UI component generation and design systems
4. **Playwright**: Browser automation and E2E testing
5. **Morphllm**: Intelligent file editing with Fast Apply
6. **Serena**: Semantic code analysis and memory management

### 4. Behavioral Modes (`SuperClaude/Modes/`)

Four behavioral modes that modify Claude's operational approach:

1. **Brainstorming Mode**: Interactive requirements discovery
2. **Introspection Mode**: Meta-cognitive analysis
3. **Task Management Mode**: Multi-layer task orchestration
4. **Token Efficiency Mode**: Intelligent compression (30-50% reduction)

### 5. Agent System (`SuperClaude/Agents/`)

13 specialized agents organized by domain:

#### Analysis Agents
- `security-auditor`: Security vulnerability detection
- `root-cause-analyzer`: Systematic issue investigation
- `performance-optimizer`: Performance bottleneck resolution

#### Design Agents
- `system-architect`: System design and architecture
- `backend-engineer`: Backend development expertise
- `frontend-specialist`: Frontend and UI development

### 6. Hooks System (`SuperClaude/Hooks/`)

Production-ready Python-based hooks system providing comprehensive framework integration:

#### Core Hook Categories
- **session_lifecycle**: Complete session management with automatic checkpointing, state persistence, and cross-session continuity
- **performance_monitor**: Real-time performance tracking with PRD target validation (<200ms memory ops, <500ms loading)
- **quality_gates**: 8-step validation cycle with automated enforcement and quality preservation
- **framework_coordinator**: Intelligent framework component coordination and orchestration

#### Implementation Features
- **Zero-config Installation**: Automatic detection and integration with existing Claude Code installations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking against PRD targets with automatic optimization suggestions
- **Session Persistence**: Automatic checkpointing with intelligent trigger detection (30min/task completion/risk level)
- **Quality Enforcement**: Automated quality gate validation with comprehensive reporting
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic fallback and recovery mechanisms

#### Hook Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Independent hook modules with clear separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven**: React to Claude Code lifecycle events and user interactions
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML-based configuration with intelligent defaults
- **Extension Points**: Plugin architecture for custom hook development

## Key Integration Patterns

### 1. Command-MCP Integration

Commands declare MCP server requirements in metadata:
```yaml
mcp-integration:
  servers: [serena, morphllm]
  personas: [backend-engineer]
  wave-enabled: true
```

### 2. Mode-Command Coordination

Modes provide behavioral frameworks, commands provide execution:
- Brainstorming Mode detects ambiguous requests
- `/sc:brainstorm` command executes discovery dialogue
- Mode patterns applied throughout execution

### 3. Intelligent Routing

The ORCHESTRATOR.md provides routing logic:
```yaml
pattern_matching:
  ui_component → Magic + frontend persona
  deep_analysis → Sequential + think modes
  symbol_operations → Serena + LSP precision
  pattern_edits → Morphllm + token optimization
```

### 4. Session Lifecycle Pattern

The Session Lifecycle Pattern enables continuous learning and context preservation:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  /sc:load   │────▶│    WORK     │────▶│  /sc:save   │────▶│    NEXT     │
│  (INIT)     │     │  (ACTIVE)   │     │ (CHECKPOINT)│     │  SESSION    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                    │                    │                    │
       └────────────────────┴────────────────────┴─ Enhanced Context ┘
```

#### Session States & Transitions

**INITIALIZING** (`/sc:load`)
- Activate project via Serena's `activate_project`
- Load existing memories and context via `list_memories`
- Build comprehensive project understanding
- Initialize session metadata and tracking structures
- Performance target: <500ms

**ACTIVE** (Working Session)
- Full project context available for all operations
- Automatic checkpoint triggers: 30min intervals, task completion, risk operations
- Decision logging and pattern recognition
- Context accumulation and learning

**CHECKPOINTED** (`/sc:save`)
- Session analysis via Serena's `think_about_collected_information`
- Persist discoveries to structured memory system
- Create checkpoint with comprehensive metadata
- Generate summaries and insights
- Performance target: <2000ms

**RESUMED** (Next Session)
- Load latest checkpoint and restore context
- Display resumption summary with work completed
- Restore decision context and active tasks
- Continue from preserved state with enhanced understanding

#### Memory Organization Strategy
```
memories/
├── session/{timestamp}           # Session records with metadata
├── checkpoints/{timestamp}       # Checkpoint snapshots
├── summaries/daily/{date}        # Daily work summaries
├── project_state/context_enhanced # Accumulated learning
└── decisions_log/                # Architecture decisions
```

#### Automatic Checkpoint Triggers
- **Time-based**: Every 30 minutes of active work
- **Task-based**: Major task completion (priority="high")
- **Risk-based**: Before high-risk operations (>50 files, architecture changes)
- **Error Recovery**: After recovering from errors or failures
