```bash
# Use when: Starting new projects, onboarding, architecture review
/sc:load project/ --comprehensive         # Project understanding
/sc:analyze . --focus architecture        # System design analysis
/sc:brainstorm "project enhancement"       # Requirements discovery
/sc:explain "complex system behavior"     # Concept clarification

# Best practice: Always start projects with discovery commands
# Time investment: 10-15 minutes upfront saves hours later
```

**Development Commands (Active Coding):**
```bash
# Use when: Implementing features, building components, coding
/sc:implement "specific feature with clear requirements"
/sc:design "system component" --type detailed
/sc:build --optimize --target production
/sc:improve code/ --type performance --measure-impact

# Best practice: Be specific in descriptions for better agent activation
# Example: Instead of "add auth", use "implement JWT authentication with rate limiting"
```

**Quality Commands (Validation and Improvement):**
```bash
# Use when: Code review, refactoring, optimization, testing
/sc:test --type comprehensive --coverage
/sc:analyze . --focus security --depth deep
/sc:cleanup --comprehensive --safe-mode
/sc:document . --audience developers

# Best practice: Run quality commands before commits and deployments
# Automation: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for consistent quality
```

**Workflow Commands (Project Management):**
```bash
# Use when: Planning, coordination, complex projects
/sc:workflow "large feature implementation"
/sc:task "project milestone" --breakdown
/sc:spawn "complex system development" --parallel
/sc:estimate "development effort" --detailed

# Best practice: Use workflow commands for >3 step processes
# Planning time: 5 minutes of planning saves 30 minutes of execution
```

### Command Optimization Strategies

**Scope Optimization for Performance:**
```bash
# Inefficient: Broad scope causing slowdowns
/sc:analyze . --comprehensive             # Analyzes entire project

# Optimized: Targeted scope for speed
/sc:analyze src/components/ --focus quality    # Specific directory
/sc:analyze auth.py --scope file --quick       # Single file analysis
/sc:analyze api/ --focus security --depth shallow  # Focused analysis

# Performance gains: 50-80% faster execution with targeted scope
```

**Context-Aware Command Selection:**
```bash
# For new projects: Discovery-first approach
/sc:brainstorm → /sc:design → /sc:workflow → /sc:implement

# For existing projects: Analysis-first approach  
/sc:load → /sc:analyze → /sc:improve → /sc:test

# For debugging: Systematic approach
/sc:troubleshoot → /sc:analyze --focus problem-area → /sc:implement fix

# For optimization: Measure-first approach
/sc:analyze --focus performance → /sc:improve --measure-impact → /sc:test --benchmark
```

**Command Chaining for Efficiency:**
```bash
# Sequential chaining for dependent operations
/sc:design "API architecture" && /sc:implement "API endpoints" && /sc:test --api-validation

# Parallel chaining for independent operations
/sc:analyze frontend/ --focus performance & /sc:analyze backend/ --focus security & wait

# Conditional chaining for quality gates
/sc:test --coverage && /sc:analyze --focus quality && /sc:improve --safe-mode

# Time savings: 30-40% reduction in total workflow time
```

# 4. All agents collaborate on production readiness checklist

# Value: Production-ready validation with comprehensive documentation
```

### Agent Selection Optimization

**Keyword Strategy for Precise Agent Activation:**
```bash
# Generic request (suboptimal agent selection)
/sc:implement "user system"
# May activate generic backend-architect only

# Optimized request (precise agent selection)
/sc:implement "secure user authentication with JWT, rate limiting, and audit logging"
# Activates: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer
# Keywords: "secure", "authentication", "rate limiting", "audit" trigger specialists

# Domain-specific optimization
/sc:implement "React TypeScript component library with Storybook and accessibility"
# Activates: frontend-architect + technical-writer + quality-engineer
# Keywords: "React", "TypeScript", "accessibility" ensure proper specialists
```

**Agent Hierarchy and Leadership Patterns:**
```bash
# Security-led development (security requirements drive implementation)
/sc:implement "payment processing system" --lead-agent security-engineer
# Security-engineer establishes requirements, others implement within constraints

# Architecture-led development (design drives implementation)
/sc:design "microservices architecture" --lead-agent system-architect
/sc:implement "service implementation" --follow-architecture
# Architecture decisions guide all implementation choices

# Performance-led optimization (performance requirements drive decisions)
/sc:improve "high-traffic API" --lead-agent performance-engineer
# Performance considerations prioritized in all optimization decisions
```

/sc:load src/ --focus architecture    # Load project context
/sc:analyze --scope module             # Understand current state  
/sc:save "analysis-complete"           # Checkpoint progress

# Multi-day development pattern
/sc:load "analysis-complete"           # Resume from checkpoint
/sc:implement "user authentication"    # Work on features
/sc:save "auth-module-done"            # Save completion state

# Cross-session coordination
/sc:load "auth-module-done"            # Previous work context
/sc:workflow "payment integration"     # Plan next phase
/sc:task "integrate stripe payment"    # Execute with context
```

**Context Management Best Practices:**
- **Checkpoint Frequently**: Save after major milestones (every 30-60 minutes)
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear session names like "payment-integration-complete"
- **Context Loading**: Always load relevant previous work before starting new tasks
- **Memory Utilization**: Use `/sc:reflect` to validate context completeness

**Session Management Examples:**
```bash
# Long-term project management
/sc:save "sprint-1-baseline"           # Sprint planning checkpoint
/sc:load "sprint-1-baseline"           # Resume development
/sc:reflect "sprint progress"          # Validate completion
/sc:save "sprint-1-complete"           # Final sprint state
```

**Scope Management Pitfalls:**
```bash
# Pitfall: Overly broad requests causing confusion
❌ /sc:implement "entire application"

# Solution: Specific, focused requests
✅ /sc:implement "user authentication with JWT and rate limiting"
✅ /sc:implement "React product catalog with search functionality"

# Results: Clear agent activation, focused output, measurable progress
```

**Performance Anti-Patterns:**
```bash
# Pitfall: Running heavy analysis on large projects without optimization
❌ /sc:analyze massive-codebase/ --comprehensive

# Solution: Staged analysis with scope optimization
✅ /sc:analyze . --quick --overview
✅ /sc:analyze problem-areas/ --focus issues --deep

# Results: 60% faster analysis, better resource utilization
```

**Session Management Mistakes:**
```bash
# Pitfall: Not saving session state regularly
❌ Long development sessions without checkpoints

# Solution: Regular session management

✅ /sc:save "feature-complete" --milestone --permanent

# Results: No lost work, easy rollback, better project continuity
```

## Quality Assurance

**Quality Assurance Practices:**

**Testing Patterns:**
```bash
# Comprehensive quality workflow
/sc:test --type unit --coverage 95%      # Unit test validation
/sc:test --type integration --critical   # Integration testing  
/sc:test --type e2e --user-journeys     # End-to-end validation
/sc:analyze --focus security --audit     # Security assessment

# Quality gates before release
/sc:analyze --focus quality --metrics    # Code quality assessment
/sc:build --optimize --validate         # Build validation
/sc:test --comprehensive --report       # Full test suite
```

**Validation Strategies:**
- **Pre-commit**: Automated linting, testing, security scanning
- **Pull Request**: Code review, integration testing, quality metrics
- **Pre-release**: Comprehensive testing, security audit, performance validation
- **Post-deploy**: Monitoring, user feedback, performance tracking

**Quality Assurance Examples:**
```bash
# Feature development quality pipeline
/sc:implement "payment processing" --test-driven
/sc:test --focus security --payment-flows
/sc:analyze --focus performance --payment-speed  
/sc:document --type security --compliance-audit

✅ Parallel: /sc:analyze file1 file2 file3 --parallel

# Pitfall: Using wrong tool for the task
❌ /sc:improve large-codebase/ (single-agent, slow)
✅ /sc:spawn "improve codebase quality" --delegate (multi-agent, fast)
```

**Agent Coordination Issues:**
```bash
# Pitfall: Fighting automatic agent selection
❌ Manually trying to control which agents activate
✅ Use appropriate keywords to trigger right agents naturally

# Pitfall: Not leveraging MCP server capabilities  
❌ Manual documentation lookup and coding
