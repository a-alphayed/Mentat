## 💬 Getting Help

### Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions and ideas
- **Documentation**: Check existing guides first

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I debug V4 framework execution and session lifecycle?**
A: Check logs in `~/.claude/` and use verbose logging. Monitor session state with `/sc:load` and `/sc:save` operations.

**Q: Can I add new MCP servers or agents?**
A: Yes! Follow the patterns in `SuperClaude/MCP/` for servers and `SuperClaude/Agents/` for domain specialists. Include proper YAML frontmatter and integration points.

**Q: How do I test V4 changes without affecting my global setup?**
A: Use a separate test environment with `python -m pip install -e .` for development installation. Backup your `~/.claude` directory and test session operations.

**Q: How do I create a new behavioral mode?**
A: Follow the pattern in `SuperClaude/Modes/` with proper YAML frontmatter, activation patterns, and framework integration configuration.

**Q: What's the difference between agents and modes?**
A: Agents provide domain expertise (system-architect, performance-engineer), while modes modify Claude's behavioral approach (brainstorming, task management, token efficiency).
