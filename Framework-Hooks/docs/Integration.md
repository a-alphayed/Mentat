# Framework-Hooks Integration with SuperClaude

## Overview

The Framework-Hooks system provides a sophisticated intelligence layer that seamlessly integrates with SuperClaude through lifecycle hooks, enabling pattern-driven AI assistance with sub-50ms performance targets. This integration transforms Claude Code from a reactive tool into an intelligent, adaptive development partner.

## 1. SuperClaude Framework Integration

### Core Integration Architecture

The Framework-Hooks system enhances Claude Code through seven strategic lifecycle hooks that implement SuperClaude's core principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Claude Code Runtime                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SessionStart → PreTool → PostTool → PreCompact → Notify   │
│       ↓            ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓       │
│   Intelligence  Routing   Validation  Compression  Updates  │
│       ↓            ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓       │
│   FLAGS.md    ORCHESTRATOR  RULES.md   TOKEN_EFF   MCP     │
│   PRINCIPLES     routing    validation  compression Updates │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
