# Dynamic Patterns: Just-in-Time Intelligence

## Overview

Dynamic Patterns form the intelligent middleware layer of SuperClaude's Pattern System, providing **real-time mode detection**, **confidence-based activation**, and **just-in-time feature loading**. These patterns bridge the gap between minimal bootstrap patterns and adaptive learned patterns, enabling sophisticated behavioral intelligence with **100-200ms activation times**.

## Architecture Principles

### Just-in-Time Loading Philosophy

Dynamic Patterns implement intelligent lazy loading that activates features precisely when needed:

```yaml
activation_strategy:
  detection_phase: "real_time_analysis"
  confidence_evaluation: "probabilistic_scoring"
  feature_activation: "just_in_time_loading"
  coordination_setup: "on_demand_orchestration"
  performance_target: "<200ms activation"
```

### Intelligence Layer Architecture

```
User Input → Pattern Matching → Confidence Scoring → Feature Activation → Coordination

   Analysis     Evaluated         Confidence >0.6    Resource Load    100-200ms
```

## Pattern Types

### 1. Mode Detection Patterns

Mode Detection Patterns enable intelligent behavioral adaptation based on user intent and context analysis.

#### Brainstorming Mode Detection

```yaml
mode_detection:
  brainstorming:
    triggers:
      - "vague project requests"
      - "exploration keywords"
      - "uncertainty indicators"
      - "new project discussions"
    
    patterns:
      - "I want to build"
      - "thinking about"
      - "not sure"
      - "explore"
      - "brainstorm"
      - "figure out"
    
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    activation_hooks: ["session_start", "pre_tool_use"]
    
    coordination:
      command: "/sc:brainstorm"
      mcp_servers: ["sequential", "context7"]
      behavioral_patterns: "collaborative_discovery"
```

**Pattern Analysis**:
- **Detection Time**: 15-25ms (pattern matching + scoring)
- **Confidence Calculation**: Weighted scoring across 17 trigger patterns
- **Activation Decision**: Threshold-based with 0.7 minimum confidence
- **Resource Loading**: Command preparation + MCP server coordination
- **Total Activation**: **45-65ms average**

#### Task Management Mode Detection

```yaml

```

### 2. MCP Activation Patterns

```

### 3. Feature Coordination Patterns

Feature Coordination Patterns manage complex interactions between modes, servers, and system capabilities.

  pattern_matching_score:
    weight: 0.4
    calculation: "keyword_frequency * pattern_strength"
    normalization: "0.0_to_1.0_scale"
    
  context_relevance_score:
    weight: 0.3
    calculation: "project_type_alignment * task_context"
    factors: ["file_types", "project_structure", "previous_patterns"]
    
  user_history_score:
    weight: 0.2
    calculation: "historical_preference * success_rate"
    learning: "continuous_adaptation"
    
  system_state_score:
    weight: 0.1
    calculation: "resource_availability * performance_context"
    monitoring: "real_time_system_metrics"
```

### Threshold Management

```yaml
threshold_configuration:
  conservative_activation:
    threshold: 0.8
    modes: ["task_management"]
    reason: "high_resource_impact"

    threshold: 0.7
    modes: ["brainstorming", "token_efficiency"]
    reason: "moderate_resource_impact"
    
  liberal_activation:
    threshold: 0.6

    reason: "low_resource_impact"
    
  adaptive_thresholds:
    enabled: true
    learning_rate: 0.1
    adjustment_frequency: "per_session"
```

## Adaptive Learning Framework
