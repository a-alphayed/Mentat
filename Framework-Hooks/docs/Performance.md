# Framework-Hooks Performance Documentation

## Performance Philosophy

### Why Performance is Critical for User Experience

Performance in the Framework-Hooks system directly impacts every aspect of the Claude Code SuperClaude experience. Unlike traditional batch processing systems, hooks execute in the critical path of user interaction, making sub-perceptible execution times essential for maintaining natural workflow.

**Core Performance Principles:**

1. **Zero Perceived Latency**: All hook operations must complete within human perception thresholds to maintain seamless interaction flow
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Performance improvements should enhance intelligence without degrading baseline functionality
3. **Resource Awareness**: Adaptive behavior based on system resource availability and constraints
4. **Evidence-Based Optimization**: All performance improvements validated through measurable metrics and user experience data

**Performance Impact Chain:**
```
Hook Performance → Session Responsiveness → User Productivity → Framework Adoption
```

**User Experience Thresholds:**
- **<50ms**: Imperceptible delay - optimal user experience
- **50-100ms**: Barely perceptible - acceptable for complex operations
- **100-200ms**: Noticeable but tolerable - requires justification through value
- **200ms+**: Disruptive to workflow - triggers performance fallbacks
