# MCP Orchestration Configuration (`mcp_orchestration.yaml`)

## Overview

The `mcp_orchestration.yaml` file configures MCP (Model Context Protocol) server coordination, intelligent routing, and optimization strategies for the SuperClaude-Lite framework.

## Purpose and Role

This configuration provides:
- **MCP Server Routing**: Intelligent selection of MCP servers based on context
- **Server Coordination**: Multi-server coordination and fallback strategies
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, load balancing, and resource management
- **Context Awareness**: Operation-specific server selection and configuration

## Key Configuration Areas

### 1. Server Selection Patterns
- **Context-Based Routing**: Route requests to appropriate MCP servers based on operation type
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum confidence levels for server selection
- **Fallback Chains**: Backup server selection when primary servers unavailable
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Choose servers based on historical performance

### 2. Multi-Server Coordination
- **Parallel Execution**: Coordinate multiple servers for complex operations
- **Result Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple servers intelligently
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicting recommendations from different servers
- **Load Distribution**: Balance requests across available servers

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Response Caching**: Cache server responses to reduce latency
- **Connection Pooling**: Manage persistent connections to MCP servers
- **Request Batching**: Batch similar requests for efficiency
- **Timeout Management**: Handle server timeouts gracefully

### 4. Context Intelligence
- **Operation Type Detection**: Identify operation types for optimal server selection
- **Project Context Awareness**: Route based on detected project characteristics
- **User Preference Integration**: Consider user preferences in server selection
- **Historical Performance**: Learn from past server performance

## Configuration Structure

The file typically includes:
- Server capability mappings (which servers handle which operations)
- Routing rules and decision trees
- Performance thresholds and optimization settings
- Fallback and error handling strategies

## Integration Points

### Hook Integration
- **Pre-Tool Use**: Server selection and preparation
- **Post-Tool Use**: Performance tracking and result validation
- **Session Start**: Server availability checking and initialization

### Framework Integration
- Works with mode detection to optimize server selection
- Integrates with performance monitoring for optimization
- Coordinates with user experience settings for personalization

## Usage Guidelines

This configuration controls how the framework routes operations to different MCP servers. Key considerations:
- **Server Availability**: Configure appropriate fallback chains
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust timeout and caching settings for your environment
- **Context Mapping**: Ensure operation types map to appropriate servers
- **Load Management**: Configure load balancing for high-usage scenarios
