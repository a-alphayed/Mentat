# Hook Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

Updated hook documentation files to accurately reflect the actual Python implementations, removing marketing language and aspirational features in favor of technical accuracy.

## Key Changes Made

### Common Updates Across All Hooks

1. **Replaced aspirational descriptions** with accurate technical implementation details
2. **Added actual execution context** including timeout values from `settings.json`
3. **Updated execution flows** to match stdin/stdout JSON processing pattern
4. **Documented actual shared module dependencies** and their usage
5. **Simplified language** to focus on what the code actually does
6. **Added implementation line counts** for context
7. **Corrected performance targets** to match configuration values

### Specific Hook Updates

#### session_start.md
- **Lines**: 704-line Python implementation
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: Lazy loading architecture, project structure analysis, user intent analysis, MCP server configuration
- **Shared Modules**: framework_logic, pattern_detection, mcp_intelligence, compression_engine, learning_engine, yaml_loader, logger
- **Performance**: <50ms target

#### pre_tool_use.md  
- **Lines**: 648-line Python implementation
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: Operation characteristics analysis, tool chain context analysis, MCP server routing, performance optimization
- **Performance**: <200ms target

#### post_tool_use.md
- **Lines**: 794-line Python implementation  
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: Validation against RULES.md and PRINCIPLES.md, effectiveness measurement, error pattern detection, learning integration
- **Performance**: <100ms target

#### pre_compact.md
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: MODE_Token_Efficiency implementation, selective compression, symbol systems
- **Performance**: <150ms target

#### notification.md
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: Just-in-time capability loading, notification type handling
- **Processing**: High/medium/low priority notification handling

#### stop.md
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds (from settings.json)  
- **Key Features**: Session analytics, learning consolidation, data persistence
- **Performance**: <200ms target

#### subagent_stop.md
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds (from settings.json)
- **Key Features**: Delegation effectiveness measurement, multi-agent coordination analytics
- **Performance**: <150ms target

## Technical Accuracy Improvements

1. **Execution Pattern**: All hooks follow stdin JSON → process → stdout JSON pattern
2. **Error Handling**: All hooks implement graceful fallback with basic functionality preservation
3. **Shared Modules**: Documented actual module imports and specific method usage
4. **Configuration**: Referenced actual configuration files and fallback strategies
5. **Performance**: Corrected timeout values and performance targets based on actual settings

## Language Changes

- **Before**: "comprehensive intelligence layer", "transformative capabilities", "revolutionary approach"
- **After**: "analyzes project context", "implements pattern detection", "provides MCP server coordination"

- **Before**: Complex architectural descriptions without implementation details
- **After**: Actual method names, class structures, and execution flows

- **Before**: Aspirational features not yet implemented  
- **After**: Features that actually exist in the Python code

## Documentation Quality

- Focused on practical implementation details developers need
- Removed marketing language in favor of technical precision
- Added concrete examples from actual code
- Clarified what each hook actually does vs. what it might do
- Made timeouts and performance targets realistic and accurate

## Files Updated

- `/docs/Hooks/session_start.md` - Major revision focusing on actual implementation
- `/docs/Hooks/pre_tool_use.md` - Streamlined to match 648-line implementation  
- `/docs/Hooks/post_tool_use.md` - Focused on validation and learning implementation
- `/docs/Hooks/pre_compact.md` - Simplified compression implementation description
- `/docs/Hooks/notification.md` - Concise notification handling description
- `/docs/Hooks/stop.md` - Session analytics and persistence focus
- `/docs/Hooks/subagent_stop.md` - Delegation analytics focus

## Result

Documentation now accurately represents what the Python implementations actually do, with humble technical language focused on practical functionality rather than aspirational capabilities.
