# SuperClaude User Guide

## The Simple Truth

**Behind the apparent complexity, SuperClaude is actually simple to use.**

You don't need to learn all the commands, flags, and agents. Just start using it!

SuperClaude has an **intelligent routing system** that tries to figure out what you need:
- Type `/analyze some-code/` ‚Üí It picks the right analysis tools
- Ask about security ‚Üí Security expert auto-activates  
- Work on frontend ‚Üí UI specialist takes over
- Debug something ‚Üí Investigation mode kicks in

**Learning emerges during use** - you'll naturally discover what works without studying manuals first.

The detailed guides below? They're here **when you want to understand** what just happened or dive deeper. But honestly? Most of the time you can just wing it.

**TL;DR**: Install it ([Installation Guide](installation-guide.md)), try `/analyze` or `/build` on your code, watch the magic happen. See [Examples Cookbook](examples-cookbook.md) for copy-paste commands.

## Just Start Here

**Want to skip the reading and jump right in?** Here's your 2-minute getting started:

```bash
# Try these commands in Claude Code:
/sc:load                    # Initialize session with project context

## Welcome & Overview

### What is SuperClaude Really?

SuperClaude makes Claude Code smarter for development work. Instead of generic responses, you get specialized help from different agents (security, performance, frontend, etc.) who know their stuff, plus session persistence and behavioral intelligence.

**The honest truth**: SuperClaude v4.0.0 represents a major architectural evolution with new session lifecycle management and behavioral modes. It's significantly more capable than v3, with better context management and intelligent agent coordination.

**The neat part?** You don't need to manage any of this complexity. Just use normal commands like `/analyze` or `/build` and SuperClaude usually figures out which experts to involve and what tools to use.

### What SuperClaude Adds

**21 Specialized Commands** ([Commands Guide](commands-guide.md))
- **Planning tools**: `/estimate`, `/task`, `/brainstorm`
- **Development tools**: `/implement`, `/build`, `/design`, `/select-tool`
- **Analysis tools**: `/analyze`, `/troubleshoot`, `/explain`
- **Quality tools**: `/improve`, `/cleanup`, `/test`
- **Session tools**: `/load`, `/save`, `/reflect` ([Session Management Guide](session-management.md))
- **Plus utilities** for documentation, git, deployment, and more

**13 Specialized Agents** *(that know when to jump in)* ([Agents Guide](agents-guide.md))
- AI agents that adapt behavior for different domains
- **Auto-activate based on your requests** (security agent for security tasks, etc.)
- Manual control available, but usually not needed  

**6 MCP Server Integrations** *(smart external tools)*
- **Context7**: Official library documentation lookup
- **Sequential**: Complex multi-step analysis  
- **Magic**: Modern UI component generation
- **Playwright**: Browser automation and testing
- **Morphllm**: Intelligent file editing
- **Serena**: Semantic code analysis and memory
- **Auto-connects when needed** - you don't manage this stuff

**5 Behavioral Modes** *(intelligent adaptation)* ([Behavioral Modes Guide](behavioral-modes-guide.md))
- **Brainstorming Mode**: Interactive requirements discovery
- **Introspection Mode**: Meta-cognitive analysis and debugging
- **Task Management Mode**: Multi-layer orchestration and systematic delegation
- **Token Efficiency Mode**: Smart compression and optimization
- **Orchestration Mode**: Intelligent tool selection and resource efficiency
- **Auto-activate based on context** - you don't configure them

**Session Lifecycle System** *(persistent intelligence)*
- Session initialization with `/sc:load`
- Persistent context and memory across sessions
- Automatic checkpoints and progress tracking
- Session reflection and insights with `/sc:reflect`
- **Cross-session learning** - SuperClaude remembers and improves

### How It Works

**The simple version**: You type something like `/analyze auth.js` and SuperClaude figures out the rest.

**The slightly more detailed version**:

1. **Smart routing** - Analyzes what you're asking for
2. **Auto-expert selection** - Picks the right specialist (security, performance, etc.)
3. **Tool coordination** - Connects to external systems when helpful
4. **Quality assurance** - Makes sure suggestions are solid

**You don't see any of this complexity** - it just feels like Claude got way smarter about development stuff.

## Core Components Overview

### Commands: Your Toolkit

Commands are specialized tools that handle specific types of development work. Instead of generic "help me with this," you get purpose-built tools for different scenarios.

**Development**: `/build`, `/design`, `/implement`
**Analysis**: `/analyze`, `/troubleshoot`, `/explain`  
**Quality**: `/improve`, `/cleanup`, `/test`
**Session Management**: `/load`, `/save`, `/reflect`
**Planning & Discovery**: `/brainstorm`, `/estimate`, `/task`
**Utilities**: `/document`, `/git`, `/select-tool`, `/spawn`, `/index`

Each command auto-activates appropriate agents and integrates with relevant MCP servers.
