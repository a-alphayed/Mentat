# SuperClaude Behavioral Modes Guide 🧠

## 💡 The Simple Truth About Modes

**You don't need to understand behavioral modes to use SuperClaude.** They work automatically in the background, adapting how Claude Code behaves based on what you're trying to do.

**Here's what actually happens:**
- Type `/sc:brainstorm "app idea"` → Brainstorming mode kicks in with discovery questions 🤔
- Work on complex debugging → Introspection mode helps with systematic analysis 🔍  
- Handle large refactoring → Task Management mode breaks it into coordinated steps 📋
- Need multiple tools → Orchestration mode picks the best ones automatically 🎯
- Context getting full → Token Efficiency mode compresses without losing meaning ⚡

**Think of it like this**: SuperClaude has different "personalities" that automatically show up when they'd be most helpful. You just work normally, and the right approach appears! ✨

---

**TL;DR**: Behavioral modes are SuperClaude's way of being smarter about how it helps you. They activate automatically. You don't manage them, they manage themselves.

---

## 🚀 Just Try These (See Modes in Action)

```bash
# Brainstorming Mode - Interactive discovery
/sc:brainstorm "task management app"     # → Gets curious, asks discovery questions

# Introspection Mode - Deep thinking
/sc:troubleshoot "weird auth behavior"   # → Analyzes reasoning patterns systematically

# Task Management Mode - Complex coordination  
/sc:implement user-dashboard             # → Breaks into phases, delegates subtasks

# Orchestration Mode - Smart tool selection
/sc:analyze large-codebase/              # → Picks best tools, coordinates efficiently  

# Token Efficiency Mode - Compressed communication
/sc:improve --uc legacy-code/            # → Uses symbols, abbreviations, stays clear
```

**See the pattern?** You just say what you want to do. SuperClaude figures out the best way to help. The modes are the "how" - you focus on the "what". 🎯

## The Five Behavioral Modes 🌟

### 🧠 Brainstorming Mode - Interactive Discovery

**What it does**: Turns SuperClaude into a collaborative discovery partner who helps you figure out what you actually want to build.

#### Automatic Activation 🪄
- **Vague requests**: "I want to build something...", "Maybe we could..."
- **Exploration words**: brainstorm, explore, discuss, figure out, not sure
- **Uncertainty**: "possibly", "thinking about", "could we"
- **Manual trigger**: `--brainstorm` or `--bs`

#### How It Changes SuperClaude 🔄
- **Socratic Dialogue**: Asks probing questions instead of jumping to solutions
- **Non-Presumptive**: Doesn't assume what you want, lets you guide discovery
- **Collaborative**: Partners with you rather than directing you
- **Brief Generation**: Turns conversations into structured requirement documents

#### Real Examples 📝

**Standard response:**
```
User: "I want to build a web app"
Claude: "I'll help you build a web application. What framework would you like to use?"
```

**Brainstorming mode:**
```
User: "I want to build a web app"
Claude: "🤔 Let's explore this together! Discovery questions:
         - What problem does this solve for your users?
         - Who are your target users and what are their main workflows?
         - What's your expected user volume and performance needs?
         - Any existing systems it needs to integrate with?
         - What's your timeline and technical constraints?
         
         📝 Once we explore these, I'll generate a structured brief for implementation!"
```

#### Perfect For 💫
- Early project planning and ideation
- Requirements discovery from vague ideas
- Turning "I need something that does..." into concrete specs
- Preventing scope creep through upfront exploration

---

## How Modes Work Together 🤝

### Mode Coordination Examples

**Building a New Feature** (Multiple Modes)
```bash
# Starts in Brainstorming Mode
/sc:brainstorm "user dashboard"
# 🧠 Discovery questions about requirements

# Transitions to Task Management Mode  
/sc:implement user-dashboard-feature
# 📋 Breaks into coordinated implementation phases

# Orchestration Mode kicks in for complex parts
# 🎯 Chooses best tools for UI (Magic MCP), testing (Playwright MCP)

# Token Efficiency if context gets full
# ⚡ Compresses communication while maintaining quality
```

**Debugging Complex Issues**
```bash
# Starts in Introspection Mode
/sc:troubleshoot "authentication randomly failing"
# 🔍 Systematic analysis of reasoning and patterns

# Orchestration Mode for tool selection
# 🎯 Uses Sequential MCP for structured investigation

# Task Management if solution is complex
# 📋 Coordinates fix across multiple files and systems
```

### Mode Priority System 📊

1. **User-Triggered** (`--brainstorm`, `--uc`, etc.) - Always override automatic
2. **Context-Critical** (Token Efficiency when context >85%) - High priority
3. **Task-Appropriate** (Task Management for 3+ steps) - Standard priority
4. **Enhancement** (Orchestration for optimization) - Background priority

### Mode Switching 🔄

Modes can:
- **Layer together**: Task Management + Orchestration + Token Efficiency
- **Switch dynamically**: Brainstorming → Task Management → Orchestration  
- **Enhance each other**: Introspection + Task Management for better quality

## Real-World Scenarios 🌍

### Scenario 1: Building a Task Management App

**Phase 1: Discovery** (Brainstorming Mode)
```bash
/sc:brainstorm "task management app for development teams"

# Mode activates automatically, provides discovery questions:
# - What problems do current tools not solve?
# - How do teams currently track tasks?
# - Integration needs with existing tools?
# - Expected team size and usage patterns?

# Result: Structured requirements brief ready for implementation
```

**Phase 2: Implementation** (Task Management Mode)
```bash  
/sc:implement task-management-app --from-brief requirements.md

# Mode activates for complex implementation:
# Phase 1: Data models and API design
# Phase 2: Core functionality and business logic  
# Phase 3: UI components and user experience
# Phase 4: Integration, testing, and deployment

# Each phase validates before proceeding
```

**Phase 3: Optimization** (Orchestration + Token Efficiency)
```bash
/sc:improve performance task-management-app/

# Orchestration selects best tools for analysis
# Token Efficiency kicks in for large codebase analysis  
# Result: Optimized, production-ready application
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging Authentication Issues

**Investigation** (Introspection Mode)
```bash
/sc:troubleshoot "users can't log in on mobile but desktop works"

# Introspection mode analyzes systematically:
# 🔍 Pattern analysis: Mobile vs desktop differences
# 🤔 Reasoning: What could cause platform-specific auth issues?
# 📊 Evidence gathering: Session handling, cookies, API calls
# 💡 Hypothesis formation and testing approach
```

**Systematic Fix** (Task Management + Orchestration)
```bash
/sc:implement auth-mobile-fix

# Task Management coordinates the fix:
# Phase 1: Mobile session analysis (Playwright MCP for testing)
# Phase 2: API compatibility fixes (Sequential MCP for logic)
# Phase 3: Cross-platform validation (multiple tools)

# Orchestration ensures optimal tool usage throughout
```

### Scenario 3: Large Codebase Refactoring

**Planning** (Brainstorming + Introspection)
```bash
/sc:brainstorm "refactor legacy PHP app to modern architecture"

# Brainstorming explores scope and requirements
# Introspection analyzes current architecture patterns
# Result: Clear migration strategy and requirements
```

**Execution** (Task Management + Token Efficiency)
```bash
/sc:refactor --delegate legacy-app/ --target modern-architecture

# Task Management breaks into systematic phases
# Token Efficiency handles large codebase analysis efficiently
# Phase coordination ensures no breaking changes
```

## FAQ 🙋

### Do I need to understand behavioral modes?

**No!** They work automatically. You focus on what you want to do, modes handle how SuperClaude helps you. Think of them like having different experts who automatically step in when needed.

### How do I know which mode is active?

Look for **behavioral markers**:
- 🤔 **Questions and exploration** = Brainstorming Mode
- 🔍 **Reasoning analysis symbols** = Introspection Mode  
- 📋 **Phase breakdowns and delegation** = Task Management Mode
- 🎯 **Tool selection matrices** = Orchestration Mode
- ⚡ **Symbols and abbreviations** = Token Efficiency Mode

### Can I disable behavioral modes?

**Yes!** Use `--no-modes` flag:
```bash
/sc:analyze --no-modes simple-file.js
```

This gives you baseline Claude behavior without mode enhancements.

### Which mode should I use manually?

**Usually none!** Automatic activation works well 95% of the time. Manual control is for:
- **Learning**: Force modes to see how they work
- **Special cases**: Unusual requirements or constraints  
- **Team coordination**: Explicit task breakdowns for collaboration
- **Performance**: Force efficiency in resource-constrained environments

### Can multiple modes be active at once?

**Yes!** Modes often layer together:
- Task Management + Orchestration (complex projects with optimal tools)
- Introspection + Token Efficiency (deep analysis with compressed output)
- Brainstorming + Task Management (discovery → implementation pipeline)

### Do modes work with all commands?

Most commands work with modes, but some have natural affinities:
- `/sc:brainstorm` → Always Brainstorming Mode
- `/sc:troubleshoot` → Often Introspection Mode  
- `/sc:implement` (complex) → Usually Task Management Mode
- Large operations → Often trigger Orchestration Mode
- High context → May activate Token Efficiency Mode

### Are modes related to agents?

**Yes, but differently!** 
- **Agents** = Who helps (security-engineer, frontend-architect, etc.)
- **Modes** = How they help (systematically, efficiently, collaboratively)

Modes determine the behavioral approach, agents provide domain expertise. A security-engineer might work in Task Management mode for complex security implementations, or Introspection mode for security analysis.
